# Object-Detection-Using-YOLO
In this project, we will use the YOLO algorithm on the PASCAL VOC Dataset to detect real-time objects.

## Introduction:
The recognition and localisation of items in an image that belong to a predetermined set of classes is the focus of the Computer Vision technology known as object detection. A neural network is trained to anticipate items in an image in the form of bounding boxes in this more complex kind of image categorization. A cutting-edge object detection technique called YOLO (You Only Look Once) uses convolutional neural networks to identify things in real time. It is well-liked because of how quick and precise it is. It generates predictions for all of the class probabilities and bounding box characteristics of an image in a single forward propagation through the CNN. Therefore, YOLO!
